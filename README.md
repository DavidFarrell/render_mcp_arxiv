**ðŸš€ How To Set Up A Remote MCP Client Server on Render.com For Anthropic and OpenAI AgentsðŸš€**

Hello!

This notebook is a practical guide for deploying your own Model Context Protocol (MCP) server remotely, using free cloud hosting on Render.

Unlike most MCP examples - which focus on running a server on your own computer to use with tools like Claude Desktop â€” this guide shows you how to host your MCP server in the cloud, making it accessible from anywhere and easy to integrate into web agents, chatbots, or even share with others.

At the end I'll also show you how to connect this up to the Claude web UI and OpenAI playground.

Once you have your MCP server deployed on Render.com you can skip to the section called ðŸ˜€Chat with Your MCP ServerðŸ˜€
